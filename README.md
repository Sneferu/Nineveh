# Nineveh
Ashurbanipal collected a library of esoteric knowledge.  My turn.


I've spent the last couple years working in system verification, running linux
on various experimental platforms and checking if it boots.  This time has taught
me that there is a tragic lack of codified resources on precisely how a linux system
works - the various daemons, tools, and paradigms used in its architecture - so
I'm going to change that.

Nineveh is based on a 2600 year old theory - originally voiced by Ashurbanipal of
Assyria - that knowledge should be esconced in a single, secure place.  He brought
esoteric texts from across his realm into his library, whereas I will take even more
esoteric texts from the net and bring them into one place where they will always be
handy.

Primarily, this work will be engineering related.  The major directory is linux,
a compendium of data for working with a linux system.  As I have recently begun
working with robotics and experimental physics, these topics may get their own
folders later.

Stay the course,
Mac Scanlan
