The /etc/fstab file dictates to a booting linux kernel which devices it should
mount and where to mount them.

Format ------------------------------------------------------------------------

The fstab file is formatted as a list of filesystem entries, each consisting
of a set of values separated by tabs.  These values are:

<filesystem>    <mountpoint>   <type>  <options>   <dump>  <pass>

filesystem:
    This variable consists of the filesystem or partition to mount.  It is
    either a special keyword (such as proc), a device (such as /dev/sda1), or
    a UUID assigned to a partition (can be found using the 'blkid' command).
    A label can also be used, formatted as "LABEL=<label>".  These labels are
    assigned to device partitions using gparted or a similar command.

mountpoint
    A location within the filesystem, or a special keyword (such as swap)

type:
    The filesystem type, includes ext2, ext3, ext4, swap, proc, etc.
    The keyword 'auto' allows the mount command to guess based on the first
    few bytes, a useful trick with hotplug devices such as CD's

options:
    Comma separated list of values:
    auto: mount automatically at boot
    noauto: opposite of auto
    exec: allow execution of binaries on the partition
    noexec: opposite of exec
    ro: mount read-only
    rw: mount read-write
    sync: synchronous I/O
    async: asynchronous I/O
    flush: for FAT filesystems, flush early, flush often
    user: permit any user to mount the filesystem (implies noexec,nosuid,nodev)
    nouser: only allow root to mount the filesystem
    suid: allow operation of suid/sgid bits (so users can access filesystem)
    nosuid: opposite of suid
    noatime: do not update inode access times on the filesystem
    dev: allow the filesystem to contain devices
    nodev: opposite of dev
    defaults: equivalent to rw,suid,dev,exec,auto,nouser,async

dump:
    Used by the dump utility to decide when to make a backup. When installed,
    dump will ignore filesystems marked with 0 and will attempt to backup
    those marked with 1.  If dump isn't installed, just put 0.

pass:
    Determine fsck checking order
    0: Fsck will not check this filesystem
    1: Root filesystem - checked first
    2: Anything else - checked afterward

Special Entries ---------------------------------------------------------------

procfs:
    Should always be included
    proc    /proc   proc    nodev,noexec,nosuid 0   0

swap:
    Swap space available to the kernel
    <dev>   none    swap    sw  0   0

tmpfs:
    tmpfs   <mount> tmpfs   rw,nodev,nosuid,size=<size>,mode=<mode> 0   0
